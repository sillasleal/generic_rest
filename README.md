# Generic REST API

A generic REST API that creates and manages JSON files based on the request path.

## ÔøΩ Motivation

This project was created to address the need for **quick API creation for testing projects at various levels**. Whether you're:

- üî¨ **Prototyping** a new frontend application
- üß™ **Testing** integration between different systems
- üìö **Learning** REST API concepts and HTTP methods
- üöÄ **Developing** proof-of-concepts rapidly
- üîÑ **Mocking** external services for development

Generic REST API provides an instant, file-based backend that adapts to your data structure automatically. No database setup, no complex configuration - just start sending requests and your API endpoints are ready to use.

## ÔøΩüöÄ Features

- **GET** - List items from a directory or get a specific item (with advanced filters)
- **POST** - Create a new item with unique UUID
- **PUT** - Update an existing item (complete replacement)
- **PATCH** - Update an existing item (partial update)
- **DELETE** - Remove an item

## üìÅ Data Structure

- Each item is saved as a JSON file with UUID name (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.json`)
- The request path corresponds to the path in the `db/` folder
- Directories are created automatically as needed

## üê≥ Using Dev Container

### Prerequisites
- VS Code installed
- "Dev Containers" extension installed
- Docker installed and running

### How to use
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to be built and configured
5. The server will start automatically on port 3000

## üìù Usage Examples

### Create a user
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Silva",
  "email": "john@email.com"
}
```

### List users
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/users
```

### List users with filters
```bash
# Exact filter
GET http://localhost:3000/users?name=John

# Wildcard filter
GET http://localhost:3000/users?name=John*

# Numeric filters
GET http://localhost:3000/products?price>=100
GET http://localhost:3000/products?price<500

# Negation filter
GET http://localhost:3000/users?status!=inactive

# Sorting
GET http://localhost:3000/users?_sort=name&_order=asc

# Pagination
GET http://localhost:3000/users?_limit=10&_offset=0

# Combining filters
GET http://localhost:3000/products?category=electronics&price>=100&_sort=price&_order=desc&_limit=5
```

### Get specific user
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/users/{uuid}
```

### Update user (complete)
```bash
PUT http://localhost:3000/users/{uuid}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Santos",
  "email": "john.santos@email.com"
}
```

### Update user (partial)
```bash
PATCH http://localhost:3000/users/{uuid}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Santos"
}
```

### Remove user
```bash
DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/{uuid}
```

### Create product in subcategory
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/products/electronics/smartphones
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "iPhone 15",
  "price": 999.99
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the server in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Start the server in development mode (with hot reload)
- `npm test` - Run all automated tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode (re-run on save)

## üß™ Tests

The project includes a complete automated test suite covering:

- ‚úÖ Item creation (POST)
- ‚úÖ Listing and search by ID (GET)
- ‚úÖ Complete (PUT) and partial (PATCH) updates
- ‚úÖ Item removal (DELETE)
- ‚úÖ All filters and operators
- ‚úÖ Sorting and pagination
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ Data persistence

### Run tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with details
npm test -- --verbose

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## üîß Configuration

### Server Port
The server runs on port 3000 by default. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

### Database Path
By default, data is saved in the project's `db/` folder. You can configure a custom path in three ways:

> **üí° Automatic Creation**: The specified directory will be created automatically during server initialization if it doesn't exist.

#### 1. Command line argument:
```bash
node src/index.js --db-path /custom/path/data
npm start -- --db-path /custom/path/data
```

#### 2. Environment variable:
```bash
DB_PATH=/custom/path/data npm start
```

#### 3. Docker/Dev Container:
```bash
# In docker-compose.yml or devcontainer.json
DB_PATH=/workspace/my-data
```

### Priority order:
1. **`--db-path` argument** (highest priority)
2. **`DB_PATH` environment variable**
3. **Default `./db`** (lowest priority)

### Usage examples:

```bash
# Use specific folder
node src/index.js --db-path /var/data/api

# Use temporary folder for tests
DB_PATH=/tmp/test-data npm run dev

# Use relative folder
npm start -- --db-path ./my-data

# Check which folder is being used (appears in startup log)
npm start -- --db-path ./custom-db
# Output: üìÅ Data directory: /workspaces/generic-rest/custom-db
```

> **üí° Tip**: The absolute path being used always appears in the server startup log for confirmation.

## üìã Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/*`     | List directory items (with filters) or get specific item by UUID |
| POST   | `/*`     | Create new item in specified directory |
| PUT    | `/*/:id` | Update existing item (complete replacement) |
| PATCH  | `/*/:id` | Update existing item (partial update) |
| DELETE | `/*/:id` | Remove item |

All endpoints respond with JSON and include appropriate error handling.

## üîç Available Filters (GET)

### Field Filters
- **Exact filter**: `?field=value` - Search for exact values (case-insensitive)
- **Wildcard**: `?field=value*` - Search with pattern using asterisk
- **Negation**: `?field!=value` - Exclude items with specified value

### Numeric Filters
- **Greater than**: `?field>10`
- **Greater or equal**: `?field>=10`
- **Less than**: `?field<100`
- **Less or equal**: `?field<=100`

### Sorting and Pagination
- **Sorting**: `?_sort=field&_order=asc|desc`
- **Pagination**: `?_limit=10&_offset=0`

### Filter Examples

```bash
# Search for electronic products with price between 100 and 500
GET /products?category=electronics&price>=100&price<=500

# Search for users whose name starts with "John"
GET /users?name=John*

# List first 10 products sorted by price (ascending)
GET /products?_sort=price&_order=asc&_limit=10

# Search for houses with more than 2 bedrooms, except inactive ones
GET /houses?bedrooms>2&status!=inactive
```

## üîÑ Difference between PUT and PATCH

### PUT - Complete Update
- Replaces **all** item content
- Fields not sent are **removed**
- Useful when you have all item data

```bash
# Original item: { "id": "123", "name": "John", "email": "john@email.com", "age": 30 }
PUT /users/123
{
  "name": "John Silva"
}
# Result: { "id": "123", "name": "John Silva", "updatedAt": "..." }
# Note that "email" and "age" were removed
```

### PATCH - Partial Update
- Updates **only** the sent fields
- Fields not sent are **preserved**
- Useful for specific changes

```bash
# Original item: { "id": "123", "name": "John", "email": "john@email.com", "age": 30 }
PATCH /users/123
{
  "name": "John Silva"
}
# Result: { "id": "123", "name": "John Silva", "email": "john@email.com", "age": 30, "updatedAt": "..." }
# Note that "email" and "age" were preserved
```
